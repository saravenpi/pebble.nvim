# Tag Completion Test Document

This document demonstrates various tag formats that the pebble.nvim tag completion system can extract and complete.

## Inline Tags

Here are some example inline tags:

- Basic tags: #productivity #workflows #automation
- Nested categories: #projects/work/client-a #projects/personal/hobby
- Technical tags: #neovim #lua #programming #vim
- Areas of focus: #areas/health/fitness #areas/learning/languages
- Resources: #resources/books #resources/articles #resources/videos

## Mixed Content with Tags

This note discusses #productivity techniques for #software-development. Some key approaches include:

1. Using #time-blocking for focused #deep-work sessions
2. Implementing #gtd (Getting Things Done) methodology 
3. Leveraging #automation tools for repetitive tasks
4. Building #workflows that support #continuous-learning

## Complex Nested Tags

Advanced organizational structures:

- #projects/work/client-a/frontend-rewrite
- #areas/health/fitness/strength-training
- #resources/courses/programming/javascript/advanced
- #inbox/to-review/articles/productivity
- #someday-maybe/learning/languages/spanish

## Tags with Numbers and Special Characters

- #year-2024 #quarter-q4 #month-12
- #version-1.0 #release-candidate-rc1
- #bug-fix #feature-request #enhancement
- #high-priority #medium-priority #low-priority

## Different Tag Styles

Some notes use different tagging approaches:

- Simple: #work #home #personal
- Hierarchical: #work/meetings #work/projects #work/admin
- Contextual: #@computer #@phone #@errands #@waiting-for
- Status: #todo #in-progress #done #cancelled

## Tags in Lists

- [ ] Complete #project-alpha #deadline-tomorrow
- [x] Review #documentation #needs-update 
- [ ] Research #new-technology #investigation-required

## Tags in Quotes and Code

Sometimes tags appear in different contexts:

> This quote mentions #inspiration and #motivation

```markdown
# Example with tags
This code block shows #example-tags and #code-formatting
```

The system should extract tags from regular text but handle edge cases appropriately.
